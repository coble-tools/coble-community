# Contribute your recipes!

If you have a recipe that you would like to contribute to the Coble project, please follow these guidelines:

## Naming and Structure
**Naming Convention:** Please use your instutution for folder in a recognisable format then a project name eg "icr/sylver". You will then create a directory and cbl file in recipes like:
`recipes/icr/sylver/sylver.cbl`

**Publication or pre-print:** The recipes are intended for academic papers in publication or pre-print for reproducibility. Please ensure that your recipe is associated with a relevant publication or pre-print and include a README.md that has the following info:
- Full reference to the publication or pre-print
- DOI or URL link to the publication or pre-print
- Link to the methods section / code availability section of the publication or pre-print
- A brief description of the recipe and its purpose
- Instructions on how to use the recipe
- Any additional information about the recipe that may be useful for users

**dockerhub**
If you include the `.DOCKERHUB` file for build to dockerhub, the image will be called: `coble/coble:icr-sylver` and available at:
[packages/coble](https://github.com/coble-tools/coble/pkgs/container/coble)

## Validation
For local builds, a validate script is optional, but for a container the validation is required so that someone can run the container then simplty run `validate.sh` to check success. It is up to you how meaningful and comprehensive the `validate.sh` file is, we will automatically only verify its existence. This file must go in the folder next to the recipe and be named "validate.sh" and should be a bash script that performs some checks on the environment or runs some code. Please look at the examples already given in recipes for guidance.

## Testing in conda
Before submitting your recipe, please test it in a conda environment to ensure that it works as expected. Test the receip with the build command:
```bash
coble build -- recipe recipes/icr/sylver/sylver.cbl --env icr-sylver-test --validate recipes/icr/sylver/validate.sh
```
Two of the outputs from the test are required alongside the input recipe for the pull request:
```
recipes/
└── icr/
        ├──sylver/
        ├── icr-sylver.cbl
        ├── icr-sylver_frozen.yaml
        └── icr-sylver_summary.txt
        └── README.md
        └── .DOCKERHUB  (optional file to request dockerhub builds)
```
 These provide the full picture of reproducibility with logs timings and errors and versions and channels.

## Submission guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Coble repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your recipe contribution.
3. **Test Your Recipe**: Before submitting, make sure to test your recipe to ensure it works as expected.
4. **Add Your files****: Add your recipe file and other files in the `recipes/icr-sylver/` directory. Ensure that your recipe follows the existing format and conventions.
5. Indicate if you would like the recipe build on DOCKER HUB CI by including a file .dockerhub
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you are satisfied with your recipe, submit a pull request to the main Coble repository. Provide a clear description of your recipe and any relevant details.
7. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may provide feedback or request changes before merging.
8. **Reprodicibility achieved!**: Once your recipe is merged, celebrate your contribution to the COBLE community!
